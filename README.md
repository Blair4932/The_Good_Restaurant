# The_Good_Restaurant
The Good Restaurant is my first ever programming project. Made with Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy and jinja it is a simple CRUD application that allows a customer to book a table based on availability as well as allowing staff a separate display to view all bookings. 

## How to run the Good Restaurant on your own Computer:

``` flask run ```
