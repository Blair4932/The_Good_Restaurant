## MVP

- Allow both Customer and Staff to create a booking for an available table
- Allow Staff to view, amend and delete a Customer's booking
- Set a table/booking capacity for the restaurant that blocks a customer from booking when capacity has been reached
- Staff should be able to change whether the booking is confirmed: True/False

## Extensions

- Add the ability to filter bookings by date
- Add a Staff class that accepts only staff login info to reach the staff view page
  (or a hard coded log in) (potentially have the ability to add new staff members + logins
  )
